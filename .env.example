CLERICAL_TEXT=The Board may correct typographical, formatting, or clerical errors, and renumber clauses accordingly, provided such corrections do not alter the substance or intent of the motion.
MOVE_TEXT=The Board may assign this change to the Articles or Bylaws as most appropriate for clarity and governance structure, and may make adjustments necessary for integration, provided the meaning of the adopted motion is preserved at the point of insertion.
FINAL_STAGE_MESSAGE=**Thanks for voting!** Getting involved is important to the sport. If you don't already volunteer some time, maybe consider itâ€”even a small commitment helps. Volunteering isn't just about refereeing or coaching; it's also about helping in other ways that help grow the sport.
