# Template Motion (To modify existing AGM/EGM voting process)
**Modernising the Voting Procedure for Motions & Amendments**  

> *This template preserves the underlying two-stage amendment-then-motion process of the VoteBuddy tool, removing organisation-specific details, so any sporting body can drop it into its own constitution or by-laws with minimal editing.*

## 1  Introduction – why change?

Most federations still rely on meeting-floor practices that pre-date online or hybrid AGMs. That tends to (a) confuse members, (b) slow decision-making, and (c) expose the board to avoidable governance risk.  
The procedure below introduces a clear amendment stage **before** the final vote on a motion, working equally well on paper, keypad, or a modern e-voting portal. In short: *members tweak first, then decide on the finished article.*  

---

## 2  Rationale (short version)

1. **Fairness** – every member can propose up to three amendments and see them voted on separately.  
2. **Transparency** – carried amendments are published before anyone votes on the motion itself.  
3. **Digital-ready** – written for either a two-stage or combined online ballot, plus an in-person fallback.  
4. **Governance‐proof** – keeps the 75 % super-majority for special resolutions, mirroring most company-law frameworks.

## 3  Special Resolution Text (clauses ready to slot straight into your rule-book)

> **Note on numbering:** “Clause 1, 2, … 9” is intentionally generic; renumber or cross-reference to fit your own Articles / By-laws.

### Clause 1 — Declaration of Ballot Type
1.1  No fewer than 14 clear days before voting opens the Chair shall publish whether the motion will be decided by:  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a) two-stage electronic ballot (Stage 1 ≙ amendments; Stage 2 ≙ motion);  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b) single-stage electronic ballot (simultaneous vote on amendments **and** motion); or  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c) in-person or hybrid ballot, taken in two consecutive stages during the meeting.  
1.2  The notice shall include the timetable for each stage and the chosen voting platform / method.

### Clause 2 — Submission & Qualification of Amendments
(a)  Amendments must reach the Secretary in writing ≥ 21 days before Stage 1 (or meeting day). Each Voting Member may lodge up to three amendments per motion.  
(b)  Each amendment must be seconded in writing by another Voting Member **or** approved by simple board majority.  
(c)  The Chair may merge duplicates, rule out amendments that negate the entire motion, and set the voting order. Rulings are published ≥ 7 days before Stage 1.  
(d)  Once published, a motion may only be withdrawn or substantively altered with Chair **and** board approval, provided the change is notified ≥ 7 days before Stage 1.  
(e)  Members can trigger a “Point-of-Order” review of any rejected/merged amendment if either 25 Voting Members **or** 5 % of the membership endorse the objection within the timescale stated.  
(f)  An amendment may bundle multiple edits if they serve one coherent purpose; the Chair may insist on splitting compound proposals for clarity.

### Clause 3 — Stage 1: Voting on Amendments
* Every qualifying amendment receives a separate yes/no vote; simple majority carries.  
* If two carried amendments conflict, an immediate run-off decides which prevails.  
* In online ballots, any run-off must finish ≥ 2 days before Stage 2 to allow publication of the final text.  
* Run-off ties: Chair casting vote → board vote → earliest-submitted amendment wins → both fall (in that order).

### Clause 4 — Stage 2: Voting on the Motion (as Amended)
(a)  The Secretary publishes the motion incorporating all carried amendments (or the original text if none were carried) plus Stage-1 results.  
(b)  Members then vote Yes / No on that final wording.  
(c)  Adoption thresholds:  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• Special resolution → ≥ 75 % of votes cast in favour.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• Ordinary resolution → simple majority.  
(d)  If the motion fails, everything lapses and the status quo remains.  
(e)  Certified results (Stage 1 + Stage 2) are published within 14 clear days (extendable to 21 in exceptional circumstances).  
(f)  The returning officer may append turnout stats and process observations.

### Clause 5 — Single-Stage Combined Ballot (optional)
Where a single ballot is declared, amendments and motion are voted on simultaneously; counts are applied in the order set out in Clauses 3 and 4. Super-majority rules still apply.

### Clause 6 — Voting Windows & Methods
(a)  Two-stage electronic ballots: Stage 1 open ≥ 7 days; Stage 2 open ≥ 5 days; Stage-1 results published ≥ 24 h before Stage 2.  
(b)  In-person/hybrid meetings: two stages taken back-to-back (hands, keypads, or secure online poll).  
(c)  An independent returning officer (not a board member or candidate) must scrutinise the vote.  
(d)  Quorum for a two-stage e-ballot is met when verified Stage-1 votes ≥ the meeting-quorum in your constitution.  
(e)  Voting methods must be accessible; reasonable adjustments provided on request.  
(f)  Failure to meet quorum in Stage 1 voids the ballot; the board either re-tables at the next General Meeting or re-runs an electronic vote with at least seven clear days’ notice.

### Clause 7 — Order of Precedence
Once an amendment is carried, any subsequent inconsistent amendment is out of order unless required for the run-off in Clause 3.

### Clause 8 — Recording of Seconds
Electronic seconds must accompany the amendment submission; in-person seconds may be confirmed orally and minuted.

### Clause 9 — Procedural Authority & Platform Review
(a)  Detailed technical rules (ballot-paper layout, proxy forms, scrutineer duties, etc.) may be set out in an AGM & Voting By-Law, provided no such By-Law conflicts with Clauses 1–8.  
(b)  Proxies (where permitted) apply across both stages unless expressly limited.  
(c)  Within nine months of adoption the board reviews whether the chosen voting platform(s) can deliver the process faithfully; it may switch provider or run a pilot ballot if needed.  
(d)  The board may extend any voting window or reschedule a meeting by up to two weeks to resolve technical failures or legal challenges, publishing reasons for transparency.  
(e)  If no qualifying amendments arrive by the deadline, Stage 1 is skipped and only Stage 2 proceeds.
