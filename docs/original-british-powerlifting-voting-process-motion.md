## Motion: Modernising the Voting Procedure for Motions and Amendments

---

### Introduction

The current voting process used by British Powerlifting, where passing an amendment replaces the original motion entirely without members directly voting on the motion itself, is outdated, cumbersome, and causes confusion—particularly during online or hybrid meetings. These flaws were acutely exposed when the May 2025 AGM had to be adjourned following an ultra vires challenge (alleging the vote exceeded the organisation's legal authority), which put the result in jeopardy.

The new process put forward in this motion proposes a clear, structured voting system ensures amendment voting fairness, provides flexibility for conducting online or in-person voting, and ensures proper governance standards are consistently met.

This motion appears long because it addresses edge cases and ensures a robust, future-proof process. But the core system it introduces is simple: members submit individual amendments, vote on them first, then vote on the final motion with any carried amendments applied. The goal is clarity, not complexity.

---

### Rationale

The current voting procedures must be updated as a matter of urgency to ensure compatibility with modern online voting, to eliminate procedural ambiguities, and to ensure a fair consistent process for tabling amendments.

A robust and transparent amendment process is fundamental to democratic integrity. It ensures that motions are properly scrutinised and improved through collective input, not just the preferences of the original proposer. Allowing only the proposer to accept or reject amendments—as is functionally the case under the current system—creates a procedural imbalance, granting disproportionate control over the final shape of a motion to a single individual. This not only restricts constructive challenge but also undermines the ability of members to refine proposals in good faith.

Additionally, the existing process limits each motion to a single amendment, with no protocol for handling multiple member-proposed changes or allowing targeted improvements to be submitted and voted on independently. This outdated approach restricts debate, favours the original proposer, presents Governance risks, and does not scale for a large, diverse membership like British Powerlifting's.

This proposed structured amendment process restores democracy and fairness, encourages collaboration, and builds motions that better reflect the will of the broader membership rather than the views of a few.

**Features of the updated procedure:**

* **Governance compliance** – Maintains the statutory 75% supermajority requirement for special resolutions, while streamlining the process for ordinary motions in a way that aligns with best practice and regulatory expectations.
* **Digital-ready by design** – Introduces a clean, platform-friendly structure: either two sequential electronic voting windows or a single combined ballot. Both formats are easily supported by standard e-voting systems or by updating our existing Google Form process, and promote accessibility.
* **Transparent and member-focused** – Ensures members know exactly which amendments have passed before voting on the final motion. The Chair is required to publish the ballot format and voting timetable at least fourteen days in advance, promoting accountability and informed participation.
* **Consistent and fair across all formats** – Applies the same two-stage logic to online, hybrid, and in-person meetings, ensuring procedural fairness and clarity regardless of format. The board has options, and members benefit from predictable, standardised processes that are easier to follow and harder to manipulate.

The potential impacts of this modernised voting process are significant. It strengthens our credibility with funders by demonstrating that British Powerlifting meets high standards of transparency, fairness, and accountability.

Major funding bodies like Sport England look for organisations with clear, democratic procedures that can manage risk and make decisions properly. By aligning with best-practice governance, we not only protect the federation legally but also improve our chances of securing future funding and partnerships.

### Motion (Special Resolution)

#### 1. Delete Articles 107–112 and insert the following new Articles 107–115

---

#### Article 107 – Declaration of ballot type

107.1 Not fewer than three clear days before voting opens the Chair shall declare that the motion will be decided by one of three methods:
(a) two-stage electronic ballot (Stage 1 = amendments; Stage 2 = motion);
(b) single-stage electronic ballot (simultaneous vote on amendments and motion); or
(c) in-person or hybrid ballot conducted in two consecutive stages during the meeting.

107.2 The declaration and the timetable for each stage shall appear in the meeting notice or, for stand-alone electronic ballots, on the voting portal.

---

#### Article 108 – Submission and qualification of amendments

(a) Amendments must reach the Secretary in writing no fewer than 21 days before Stage 1 (or, for an in-person meeting, no fewer than 21 days before the meeting). Each Voting Member may submit a maximum of three amendments per motion. The Board or Chair may combine substantially similar amendments at their discretion to ensure procedural efficiency. Members wishing to submit additional proposals may do so by encouraging a different Voting Member to submit or second those amendments independently.

(b) Each amendment must be seconded in writing by another Voting Member or be approved by a simple majority of the Board or the Chair. A proposer may not second his or her own amendment.

(c) The Chair may merge duplicative amendments, rule out any that negate the entire motion, and set the voting order. Rulings are published no fewer than 7 days before Stage 1.

(d) Once published for voting, a motion may only be withdrawn or substantively altered by its proposer with the approval of the Chair and a majority of the Board, provided that the change is published no fewer than 7 days before Stage 1. Minor clerical or formatting corrections may be made at the discretion of the Chair and must be disclosed to the membership when voting opens.

(e) If the Chair declines to accept an amendment under Article 108(a) or merges it under Article 108(c), ten or more Voting Members may submit a written objection ("Point of Order") within five clear days of the publication of rulings. Upon receipt of such objection, the Board shall publish a short explanation of the decision. If within a further five clear days, at least 25 Voting Members or 5% of the total Voting Membership (whichever is higher) support the objection in writing, the amendment shall be reinstated for Stage 1 voting unless its inclusion would conflict with the law or these Articles, in which case the Governance Committee or an independent legal adviser shall determine the matter. If time does not permit resolution before the vote, the amendment shall be deferred to the next General Meeting and tabled as a separate motion.

(f) An amendment may include multiple edits, provided they serve a single coherent purpose or effect a logically unified change to the motion. Amendments must not combine substantively unrelated or independent revisions. The Chair shall have discretion to determine whether an amendment exceeds this scope and may, where appropriate, require that compound amendments be separated, redrafted, or resubmitted individually for clarity and procedural fairness.

(g) Once the amendment deadline passes, all qualifying amendments shall be published for member review and comment. No further amendments may be submitted during this period, which shall last no fewer than five clear days before Stage 1 opens.

#### Article 109(a) – Stage 1: voting on amendments

Every qualifying amendment is voted on separately; a simple majority of votes cast carries. Conflicting carried amendments are resolved immediately by a run-off vote; the higher vote prevails, the other(s) fall. Carried amendments are incorporated forthwith. In the case of online votes, any such runoff vote will be conducted between stages and require an extension of the voting window or AGM to facilitate. Online runoff votes shall be conducted ≥ 2 days before Stage 2.

In the event of a tie in a run-off vote between conflicting amendments, the Chair shall cast the deciding vote unless the Chair has a declared conflict of interest, in which case the Board shall determine the outcome by majority vote. If the Board is also tied, the amendment with the earliest submission date shall prevail. Failing that, the run‑off is deemed lost, and the unamended motion proceeds to Stage 2.

---

#### Article 110 – Stage 2: voting on the motion as amended

(a) After Stage 1 the Secretary publishes (i) the motion incorporating all carried amendments, or (ii) the unamended motion if none were carried, together with Stage-1 results.
(b) Members then vote Yes or No on the motion.
(c) Adoption threshold:

* If the motion is a special resolution under the Companies Act 2006, it is adopted only if at least 75% of votes cast are in favour.
* Any other motion is adopted by a simple majority of votes cast.
  (d) If the motion fails, the motion and all Stage-1 amendments lapse and the status quo ante continues to apply.
  (e) The returning officer's certified Stage 2 result and a summary of Stage 1 voting shall be published to all Voting Members within fourteen clear days of the close of Stage 2. If publication is not reasonably possible within that timeframe due to exceptional circumstances or platform delays, the Chair shall publish a holding notice and ensure full results are published as soon as practicable, and no later than twenty-one clear days after close of voting.
  (f) The returning officer's report may include summary turnout data and any observations relevant to the conduct or integrity of the vote.

---

#### Article 111 – Single-stage combined electronic ballot

Where the Chair designates a single-stage ballot, Members vote simultaneously on each amendment and on the motion. Counts are applied in the order of Articles 109 and 110. The 75% super-majority still applies to any special resolution.

---

#### Article 112 – Voting windows and methods

(a) For two-stage electronic ballots Stage 1 must be open for at least five clear days and Stage 2 for at least five clear days; Stage-1 results must be published no fewer than 24 h before Stage 2 opens.
(b) For in-person or hybrid meetings the two stages are taken consecutively using show of hands, electronic keypads or secure online polling, at the Chair's discretion. The agenda should allow sufficient time between stages to hold any necessary run-off vote.
(c) In all cases the ballot shall be scrutinised by an independent returning officer, who must not be a current Board member, candidate in the vote, or person with a direct conflict of interest. The returning officer shall be appointed by the Board and, where a Governance Committee is constituted, in consultation with that Committee.
(d) For a two‑stage electronic ballot the quorum is reached when the number of verified votes cast in Stage 1 equals or exceeds the physical‑meeting quorum in Article 101.
(e) Voting methods shall be accessible to members with disabilities, with alternative formats or assistance provided on reasonable request.
(f) Failure to meet quorum in Stage 1: If Stage 1 fails to meet quorum as defined in Article 112(d), the vote shall be declared null and void. The Chair shall publish a notice within five clear days explaining the failure and its implications. The motion in question may then either:
 (i) be re-tabled at the next AGM or EGM; or
 (ii) be submitted for a fresh electronic ballot under a revised timetable, provided that members are given no fewer than seven clear days' notice.
Where practical, the Board should consult the Governance Committee (if constituted) before determining the appropriate next step, ensuring the decision aligns with democratic principles and platform logistics.

---

#### Article 113 – Order of precedence

Once an amendment has been carried, any subsequent amendment inconsistent with it is out of order unless required for the run-off in Article 109.

---

#### Article 114 – Recording of seconds

Seconds submitted electronically must accompany the amendment; seconds given in person may be confirmed orally and recorded in the minutes.

---

#### Article 115

(a) **By-Law authority:** Detailed provisions on ballot-paper format, platform specification, scrutineer duties and proxy recording may be set out in an "AGM & Voting By-Law", provided no such By-Law is inconsistent with Articles 107-114. The Board may revise an AGM & Voting By-Law by simple majority provided the change is purely procedural and does not alter any voting threshold or member right established in the Articles.
(b) Where proxy voting is permitted under the Companies Act 2006 or any applicable By-Law, proxies shall be valid across both Stage 1 and Stage 2 unless explicitly limited. The AGM & Voting By-Law may further specify the process for proxy appointment, revocation, submission deadlines, and how proxy instructions apply in the case of run-off votes. Any later‑dated proxy revokes earlier instructions automatically.
(c) In the event of a technical failure, legal challenge, or other exceptional circumstance that prevents proper execution of Stage 1 or Stage 2, the Board may extend the relevant voting window or reschedule the AGM or EGM by up to two weeks by simple majority (board vote), provided that written justification is published alongside the revised timetable. This power shall only be used to preserve democratic fairness and the integrity of the vote.
(d) In the event of an administrative error or the need for an additional vote—such as a runoff vote between clashing amendments in an online form format—the voting period may be extended by up to two weeks to facilitate the necessary process, and the AGM rescheduled. Any such extension requires board approval by a simple majority.
(e) If no qualifying amendments are submitted by the deadline, Stage 1 (amendment voting) shall be deemed unnecessary and skipped, and only Stage 2 (a vote on the original motion) shall be conducted in accordance with Article 110.
(f) All subsequent Articles shall be renumbered consecutively and every internal cross‑reference updated accordingly.

#### 2. Amend Article 96 (notice of meeting)

After "the general nature of the business to be transacted," insert:
"and shall specify the ballot type chosen under Article 107 and, where relevant, the opening and closing times of each electronic voting stage. **Motion submissions open immediately upon issuance of the Initial Notice.**"

---

#### 3. Platform Compatibility and Procedural Review

* Within nine months of adopting these Articles, the Board—together with the Chair and CEO—shall review the voting platform(s) and associated administrative processes to ensure they fully support the implementation of Articles 107–115. This includes but is not limited to: staged amendment and motion voting, run-off votes, independent scrutiny, proxy handling, and transparent publication of results.
* If the review concludes that the process can be executed faithfully and reliably on the current platform(s), the Board may continue using them. If any technical limitations or operational constraints are identified, the Board may:

  * (a) adopt an alternative system or provider;
  * (b) implement administrative procedures or platform-neutral workarounds; or
  * (c) conduct a non-binding pilot ballot using a different platform to validate capability and member experience.
* Any such pilot must simulate the intended voting process in full and be overseen by the returning officer (or Governance Committee, if constituted). The pilot's results shall be advisory only and published for transparency.
* The Board shall retain authority—by simple majority—to change, replace, or reconfigure the voting platform at any time, provided that the Articles 107–115 process can still be executed as written. No particular provider or system is implied, required, or granted exclusivity.
* If a future change would materially alter voting thresholds, member rights, or sequencing under Articles 107–115, it must be submitted for ratification at an AGM or EGM. Otherwise, the Board may approve all implementation details internally.
* The Secretary may, without member approval, make minor clerical adjustments to reflect updated platform or product names, correct cross-references, or fix formatting or typographic errors, provided that no substantive rights are affected. All such changes shall be logged and published in the next governance update.
* "The term 'Secretary' refers to the person appointed by the Board to carry out the duties of Company Secretary, whether formally titled as such or not.
* For the avoidance of doubt, while this motion references the Sport80 system, it does not establish, imply, or require exclusivity or continued use of that or any specific provider. The British Powerlifting Board reserves the right to implement the online voting process using any platform or method, provided that the process requirements are met in full.

### Intended Outcome

Adopting this motion will modernise and clarify British Powerlifting's voting procedures, delivering significantly improved transparency, procedural fairness, and member engagement while **dramatically compressing the timeline from initial notice to final vote**.

**Key Timeline Improvements:**
* **Day-One Motion Opening**: Motion submissions open immediately upon Initial Notice, eliminating the previous two-week delay
* **Streamlined Final Notice**: Reduced from 14 to 3 days before Stage 1, allowing faster pack preparation
* **Efficient E-Ballots**: Stage 1 voting reduced from 7 to 5 days for electronic ballots, maintaining democratic participation while accelerating decisions
* **Extended Amendment Window**: 5-day amendment review period ensures thorough member consideration
* **Results Processing Buffer**: Recommended 3-day gap between Stage 2 close and AGM to allow adequate time for results processing and documentation preparation

By separating amendment decisions from final motion votes, retaining the statutory 75% threshold for special resolutions, and offering flexible ballot formats (electronic or in-person), this process brings British Powerlifting into closer alignment with Sport England's Code for Sports Governance and following Robert's Rules of Order best practices.

The two-stage structure also enhances democratic scrutiny, ensuring members vote on fully-formed motions, not just the original text. This fosters confidence in the process, creates clearer audit trails, and reduces confusion—especially in hybrid or digital contexts. The result is a more inclusive, robust governance model that strengthens organisational resilience, supports regulatory compliance, and improves the sport's appeal to members, partners, and potential funders.

To enable this, the Board, Chair, and CEO are empowered to review the platform implementation and procedural framework. If the process can be adopted as written, it will be implemented immediately. If procedural changes are deemed necessary, those changes must be returned to the membership for ratification at a future AGM or EGM.

**Note:** AGMs should plan for a potential two-day window between Stage 1 and Stage 2 to allow time for any necessary run-off votes between conflicting amendments. Additionally, it is recommended that Stage 2 voting close at least 3 days before the AGM date to provide adequate time for results processing, documentation preparation, and any necessary follow-up actions, though this is not a strict requirement. This motion also mandates a formal platform compatibility and process review (e.g., of Sport80) within nine months, ensuring operational readiness and faithfulness to the Articles ahead of the 2026 AGM.
