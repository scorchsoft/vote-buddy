# Voting Help

## Overview of the stages

The voting process happens in four clear steps:

1. **[Submit] Motions submitted** – members use the **Submit Motion** link to file new motions and propose amendments before the notice deadline.
2. **[Review] Review window** – coordinators check each submission complies with the By‑Laws. During this period you can still open a motion and submit further amendments.
3. **[Stage 1 votes] Amendments** – qualifying amendments are published and voted on first. Conflicting carried amendments may trigger a run‑off vote so the preferred wording can be chosen.
4. **[Stage 2 votes] Motions** – members then vote on the final motion text with any carried amendments applied. A 75% majority is needed for special resolutions.

Some ballots combine amendment and motion questions in one form but the order remains the same: see the changes then vote on the motion.

By default a tied amendment is decided by the Chair's casting vote. If the Chair cannot act, the earlier‑submitted amendment prevails.

## How voting links work

Each eligible member receives an email with a unique link. This link contains a secure token identifying you and the stage. Tokens can only be used once (unless revoting is enabled) and only during the advertised voting window. Do not share your link with others.

If you act as a proxy you will receive a separate token for the represented member. Either you or the original member may vote, but only the first ballot submitted is counted.

For more details see Articles 107–115 in the governance documents.

## Calendar reminders

The public meeting page lists the opening and closing times for each stage.
Use the **Add to calendar** links beside Stage 1, any run-off and Stage 2 to
download an `.ics` file that you can import into most calendar apps.

## Submitting motions and amendments

Before the notice deadline you can propose new motions or submit amendments to
published motions.

1. When the submission window opens you'll receive a special **Submit Motion**
   link by email. This link includes a personal token authorising submissions.
2. Keep that email handy&mdash;the same token lets you submit amendments. Open
   the motion you wish to change and click **Submit Amendment** to access the
   form.
3. After submitting you'll see a confirmation message while coordinators review
   your proposal.

## Manual tally entry

When a meeting uses **in-person** ballot mode no voting links are sent.
Coordinators record the counts after each stage instead.
Use the *Stage&nbsp;1 Tally* and *Stage&nbsp;2 Tally* forms on the admin
results page to enter the numbers of votes cast. Stage&nbsp;1 only stores a
single "votes cast" value for quorum checks. Stage&nbsp;2 captures the final
For/Against/Abstain totals.

## Keyboard navigation

All voting controls can be reached using the Tab key. After making your choices, the sticky confirmation bar becomes the final Tab stop with a prominent **Submit vote** button.

## Coordinators: resending links

If a member misplaces their invite or the token has expired, coordinators can resend the voting link from the admin results page. Use the **Resend link** button beside the member's name to generate a fresh token for the current stage and email it immediately.

## Verifying your vote receipt

After voting you will receive an email containing one or more hash values. These hashes act as your receipt. Visit [the receipt checker](/vote/verify-receipt) and enter a hash to confirm it matches a recorded vote.
