## Overview of the stages

British Powerlifting motions are decided in two parts:

1. **Stage 1 – amendments**: members vote on each proposed change to the motion. If no amendments qualify this stage may be skipped.
2. **Stage 2 – motion**: members vote on the final motion text after any carried amendments have been applied. A 75% majority is required for special resolutions.

Some ballots may combine these into one form but the sequence stays the same: know what has changed, then cast your vote on the motion.

## How voting links work

Each eligible member receives an email with a unique link. This link contains a secure token identifying you and the stage. Tokens can only be used once (unless revoting is enabled) and only during the advertised voting window. Do not share your link with others.

If you have been appointed as a proxy, a token will be issued for the represented member as well. Casting your vote records it for both accounts.

For more details see Articles 107–115 in the governance documents.
