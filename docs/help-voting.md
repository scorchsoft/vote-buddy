# Voting Help

## Overview of the stages

British Powerlifting motions are decided in two parts:

1. **Stage 1 – amendments**: members vote on each proposed change to the motion. If no amendments qualify this stage may be skipped.
2. **Stage 2 – motion**: members vote on the final motion text after any carried amendments have been applied. A 75% majority is required for special resolutions.

Some ballots may combine these into one form but the sequence stays the same: know what has changed, then cast your vote on the motion.

By default a tied amendment vote is decided by the Chair's casting vote. If the Chair is unable to act, the earlier-submitted amendment prevails.

## How voting links work

Each eligible member receives an email with a unique link. This link contains a secure token identifying you and the stage. Tokens can only be used once (unless revoting is enabled) and only during the advertised voting window. Do not share your link with others.

If you act as a proxy you will receive a separate token for the represented member. Either you or the original member may vote, but only the first ballot submitted is counted.

For more details see Articles 107–115 in the governance documents.

## Calendar reminders

The public meeting page lists the opening and closing times for each stage.
Use the **Add to calendar** links beside Stage 1, any run-off and Stage 2 to
download an `.ics` file that you can import into most calendar apps.

## Submitting motions and amendments

Before the notice deadline you can propose new motions or submit amendments to
published motions.

1. When the submission window opens you'll receive a special **Submit Motion**
   link by email. Follow it to fill out a short form with your motion title,
   text and chosen seconder.
2. After submitting you'll see a confirmation message while coordinators review
   your proposal.
3. To change an existing motion, open it on the meeting page and click
   **Submit Amendment**. Enter your wording and seconder just like the motion
   form. You'll get an email once your amendment is accepted or rejected.

## Manual tally entry

When a meeting uses **in-person** ballot mode no voting links are sent.
Coordinators record the counts after each stage instead.
Use the *Stage&nbsp;1 Tally* and *Stage&nbsp;2 Tally* forms on the admin
results page to enter the numbers of votes cast. Stage&nbsp;1 only stores a
single "votes cast" value for quorum checks. Stage&nbsp;2 captures the final
For/Against/Abstain totals.

## Keyboard navigation

All voting controls can be reached using the Tab key. After making your choices, the sticky confirmation bar becomes the final Tab stop with a prominent **Submit vote** button.

## Coordinators: resending links

If a member misplaces their invite or the token has expired, coordinators can resend the voting link from the admin results page. Use the **Resend link** button beside the member's name to generate a fresh token for the current stage and email it immediately.

## Verifying your vote receipt

After voting you will receive an email containing one or more hash values. These hashes act as your receipt. Visit [the receipt checker](/vote/verify-receipt) and enter a hash to confirm it matches a recorded vote.
