## Overview of the Governance Process

VoteBuddy implements a comprehensive governance process that ensures proper notice, democratic participation, and transparent decision-making.

### Two-Notice System

The process follows a governance-compliant two-notice system:
- **Initial Notice:** Basic meeting announcement (≥21 days before motion submissions close)
- **Final Notice:** Complete agenda with all amendments (≥14 days before voting begins)

### Process Timeline

1. **[Initial Notice]** – Basic meeting announcement published ≥21 days before motion submissions close
2. **[Motions Open]** – Members submit new motions and board proposals using the **Submit Motion** link
3. **[Amendments Open]** – Members submit amendments to published motions (up to 3 per motion per member)
4. **[Final Notice]** – Complete agenda with all qualifying amendments published ≥14 days before voting
5. **[Amendment Review]** – Members review and comment on all amendments before voting begins (≥5 days)
6. **[Stage 1 Voting]** – Vote on amendments separately. Conflicting carried amendments trigger run-off votes
7. **[Stage 2 Voting]** – Vote on final motions with carried amendments applied. 75% majority needed for special resolutions

Some ballots may combine the voting stages into one form, but the sequence stays the same: amendments are decided first, then you vote on the final motion with any carried amendments applied.

### Governance Requirements

- **Initial Notice:** ≥21 days before motion submissions close
- **Amendment Deadline:** ≥21 days before Stage 1 voting
- **Final Notice:** ≥14 days before voting with complete agenda
- **Review Period:** ≥5 days for members to comment on amendments
- **Special Resolutions:** Require 75% majority in Stage 2

By default a tied amendment is decided by the Chair's casting vote. If the Chair cannot act, the earlier‑submitted amendment prevails.

## Submitting Motions & Amendments

### Motion Submission
- Available during the **Motions Open** window (after Initial Notice)
- Use the **Submit Motion** link emailed to eligible members
- Each motion requires a seconder or board approval
- Submissions close ≥21 days before Stage 1 voting begins

### Amendment Submission
- Up to **3 amendments per motion** per member
- Available during the **Amendments Open** window
- Each amendment must be seconded or board-approved
- Chair may merge similar amendments or rule out invalid ones
- Members can object to chair rulings if supported by enough members

## How voting links work

Each eligible member receives an email with a unique link. This link contains a secure token identifying you and the stage. Tokens can only be used once (unless revoting is enabled) and only during the advertised voting window. Do not share your link with others.

If you act as a proxy you will receive a separate token for the represented member. Either you or the original member may vote, but only the first ballot submitted is counted.

For more details see Articles 107–115 in the governance documents.

## Calendar reminders

The public meeting page lists the opening and closing times for each stage.
Use the **Add to calendar** links beside Stage 1, any run-off and Stage 2 to
download an `.ics` file that you can import into most calendar apps.

## Submitting motions and amendments

Before the notice deadline you can propose new motions or submit amendments to
published motions.

1. When the submission window opens you'll receive a special **Submit Motion**
   link by email. This link includes a personal token authorising submissions.
2. Keep that email handy&mdash;the same token lets you submit amendments. Open
   the motion you wish to change and click **Submit Amendment** to access the
   form.
3. After submitting you'll see a confirmation message while coordinators review
   your proposal.

## Manual tally entry

When a meeting uses **in-person** ballot mode no voting links are sent.
Coordinators record the counts after each stage instead.
Use the *Stage&nbsp;1 Tally* and *Stage&nbsp;2 Tally* forms on the admin
results page to enter the numbers of votes cast. Stage&nbsp;1 only stores a
single "votes cast" value for quorum checks. Stage&nbsp;2 captures the final
For/Against/Abstain totals.

## Keyboard navigation

All voting controls can be reached using the Tab key. After making your choices, the sticky confirmation bar becomes the final Tab stop with a prominent **Submit vote** button.

## Coordinators: resending links

If a member misplaces their invite or the token has expired, coordinators can resend the voting link from the admin results page. Use the **Resend link** button beside the member's name to generate a fresh token for the current stage and email it immediately.

## Verifying your vote receipt

After voting you will receive an email containing one or more hash values. These hashes act as your receipt. Visit [the receipt checker](/vote/verify-receipt) and enter a hash to confirm it matches a recorded vote.
